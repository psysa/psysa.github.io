On a good day we can be having beers and debating while on another we can literally rant for hours one end, and I think that's special...

You've been around for pretty much all my best memories from college, and I can't imagine how different my time there would have been without you around. Oh, and your talent and flair for things is just incredible dude, and I'm floored by how good you're at the things you do. Might as well say that you're my personal example for a sakala-kala vallabhan üòÇ, and I mean every word of it.
