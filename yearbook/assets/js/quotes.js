LOL\nFrom being not selected as class rep to being our co-captain you have grown so much without losing yourself da.\nI remember us boys calling you on your bday and we hung up, but I remember you being so happy about it.\nIt's good to have somebody on the side not losing hope in our class, but unfortunately you have to do it alone now.\nSo Pooja Sekhar, I still have that pact ka recording and you would owe me a biriyani from Hyderabad.\nTake care yo!

On a good day we can be having beers and debating while on another we can literally rant for hours one end, and I think that's special... Finding out that we spent a week or so in Kolkata two years prior to college was a pleasant, shocking suprise - oh how people come together... You've been around for pretty much all my best memories from college, and I can't imagine how different my time there would have been without you around. Oh, and your talent and flair for things is just incredible dude, and I'm floored by how good you're at the things you do. Might as well say that you're my personal example for a sakala-kala vallabhan 😂, and I mean every word of it. It's also remarkable that you care deeply about things outside our own closeted world, and we certainly need more people like that...  Thanks for sticking with me man...

These four years of college flew by. I will miss all those times together in the class, sharing lunch and at the canteen together having a coffee. Thank you for being always honest with me and for motivating me to do things that I'm capable of. I can’t imagine college without you and your antics, humour and sweet gestures. One thing I know is you're my friend for life. I'm always just a call away. Love you! :) "

Never stop blabbering, that's what makes you so special. You are the friend anyone could ask for! Thanks for putting up with me and making me laugh no matter what. My only regret in college is not being friends with you guys earlier on. Where did all the time go? I will miss you like crazy. CSA wouldn’t have been the same without you for me. Btw, Delhi sucks Kochi rocks. Love you to the moon! :) "

Having her around is so much fun, and her back-bench stories are some of the best conversations I've had with anyone, period. And, I must say you're like a giant teddy bear when it comes to emotional support, and your advice has always given something me to think about to lift my spirits whatever the situation...
