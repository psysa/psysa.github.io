Even though we were\ntogether for only less that 3 semesters, I am sure the bond between us is more than that. As a class tutor, it\nwas very easy and comfort for me to mentor your batch. As a teacher, it was a pleasure for me to lecture\nin your class. I don’t remember even a single occassion I was forced to scold at you. You were so loving,\ncool, sincere and dedicated.\n\nIt is upsetting to miss the last few weeks in your college life. But, I am sure you have\ncompensatd it to some extent with the help of technology. I want to thank you for all the warmth\nmemories and learning that we had together. I too learned many things from you.\nDear students, there is a new phase waiting for you with a new career and dreams. My prayer is\nthat you will all excell in your future endeavours. I really love your batch. All the best dear students.\nJiby J.Puthiyidam",
